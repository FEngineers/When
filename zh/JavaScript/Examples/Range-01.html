    A Range identifies a range of content in a Document, DocumentFragment or Attr.
    It is contiguous in the sense that it can be characterized as selecting all of the content between a pair of
    boundary-points.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note: In a text editor or a word processor, a user can make a selection by pressing down the mouse at one point in a
    document,
    moving the mouse to another point, and releasing the mouse.
    The resulting selection is contiguous and consists of the content between the two points.
  </p>

  <p>
    The term 'selecting' does not mean that every Range corresponds to a selection made by a GUI user;
    however, such a selection can be returned to a DOM user as a Range.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note: In bidirectional writing (Arabic, Hebrew), a range may correspond to a logical selection that is not necessarily
    contiguous when displayed.
    A visually contiguous selection, also used in some cases, may not correspond to a single logical selection,
    and may therefore have to be represented by more than one range.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Range interface provides methods for accessing and manipulating the document tree at a higher level than
    similar methods in the Node interface. The expectation is that each of the methods provided by the Range interface for
    the insertion,
    deletion and copying of content can be directly mapped to a series of Node editing operations enabled by DOM Core.
    In this sense, the Range operations can be viewed as convenience methods that also enable the implementation to
    optimize common editing patterns.
