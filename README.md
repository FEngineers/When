When to use them ?

I want to understand when to those properties, methods, libraries, frameworks...

Why use 'WHEN' ?

Some times we were asked like below questions:

* What is Flow or Why we need Flow

* What is TypeScript or Why we need TypeScript

* What is RxJs or Why we need RxJS

But, I don't like those questions.

I like questions as below:

* When we use Flow

* When we use TypeScript

* When we use RxJS

Because, when we know when to use a new stuff, that's the time we really understand it.
